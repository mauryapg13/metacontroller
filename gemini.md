### What was done
- Diagnosed and fixed a major server startup issue that was causing connection timeouts.
- The root cause was a deadlock in the `torch` and `transformers` libraries, likely due to incompatible versions.
- The debugging process involved:
    - Analyzing the application code.
    - Attempting to run the server in the foreground to see the logs.
    - Dealing with "Address already in use" errors by finding and killing zombie processes.
    - Redirecting the server output to a log file to finally see the logs.
- The final solution involved several steps:
    - Pinning the versions of all the libraries in `requirements.txt` files to known compatible versions.
    - Modifying the `backend/app.py` to load the machine learning model in a background thread to prevent it from blocking the server startup.
    - Adding a `/health` endpoint to the backend to monitor the model loading status.
    - Adding logging to the backend to get more insights into the application's behavior.
    - Modifying the backend to be runnable with `python3 backend/app.py`.
- The server is now starting up quickly and is responsive.

### Next steps
- Await further instructions from the user.

### What was done
- Created the initial project structure for the `smart-prompt-router`.
- Populated `data/prompts.csv` with sample data and later expanded it to 250 rows.
- Implemented a training script (`scripts/train.py`) to fine-tune a DistilBERT model for prompt classification.
- Developed a FastAPI backend (`backend/app.py`) to serve the trained model via a `/classify` endpoint.
- Built a comprehensive frontend dashboard (`frontend/index.html`) with the following features:
    - Real-time prompt classification.
    - Display of routing decisions, confidence, and classification time.
    - Placeholders for multi-agent responses.
    - A dynamic history of submitted queries.
    - A dark/light mode theme toggle.
- Debugged and resolved a CORS issue in the backend by adding `CORSMiddleware`.

### Next steps
- Await further instructions from the user.

### Notes
- The model's perfect accuracy is likely due to overfitting on the duplicated dataset.
- The backend server is currently running as a background process.
- Instructions for running the frontend and backend have been provided.

### What was done
- Updated the `README.md` file with a more detailed project description, setup instructions, and project structure.
- Troubleshooted and resolved several `git push` issues:
    - Handled large files by creating a `.gitignore` file to exclude the `models/distilbert-prompt-classifier/` directory.
    - Removed sensitive files (`metacontroller-backup`, `metacontroller.pub`, `metacontroller`) from the project and added them to `.gitignore`.
    - Resolved git history conflicts by resetting the repository and performing a force push.
- Successfully pushed the project to the user's GitHub repository, excluding the large model files and sensitive files.

### Next steps
- Await further instructions from the user.

### Notes
- The project is now on GitHub.
- The local git history was reset to resolve push conflicts.
