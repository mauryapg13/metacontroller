### What was done
- Created the initial project structure for the `smart-prompt-router`.
- Populated `data/prompts.csv` with sample data and later expanded it to 250 rows.
- Implemented a training script (`scripts/train.py`) to fine-tune a DistilBERT model for prompt classification.
- Developed a FastAPI backend (`backend/app.py`) to serve the trained model via a `/classify` endpoint.
- Built a comprehensive frontend dashboard (`frontend/index.html`) with the following features:
    - Real-time prompt classification.
    - Display of routing decisions, confidence, and classification time.
    - Placeholders for multi-agent responses.
    - A dynamic history of submitted queries.
    - A dark/light mode theme toggle.
- Debugged and resolved a CORS issue in the backend by adding `CORSMiddleware`.

### Next steps
- Await further instructions from the user.

### Notes
- The model's perfect accuracy is likely due to overfitting on the duplicated dataset.
- The backend server is currently running as a background process.
- Instructions for running the frontend and backend have been provided.
